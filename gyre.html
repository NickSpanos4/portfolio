        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>Group project from Materials in Design course to design and build a flashlight prototype for a specific persona,
          i.e. an electrician or teacher. For this team project, each member came up with their own design concepts for their
          personas and the best would be chosen: mine was chosen. Through the development period, I managed the time and assignment
          of roles to be as efficient as possible, which resulted in an A grade.  The project strengthened my abilities in; ideation
          processes, prototyping skills (modelling), and research (for the persona).

        <h3>Sketching & Dimensioning</h3>
        <p>After I had chosen to design the flashlight for an electrician, I took care to keep the prototype within a specific
          range of percentile measurements, in order to fit the largest margin of people. Taking this into account, I centered the
          design of the flashlight on principles which would best assist an electrician to do their job. These principles included:
          hands free use, focused light projection, and different ways to hold. As I had a limited time for ideation, I settled on
          my initial sketch to move forward with when creating a physical prototype. </p>
          <br>
          <p><i>Thought Process:</i></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thorough planning when creating each part</li>
            <li>Adhering to a specific design principle</li>
            <li>Clear presentation of product details</li>

        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>The next step was to transfer the idea from paper to a physical, foam version with help from the detailed sketch.
          Following those measurements and taking into account the characteristics of the material, I took a step-by-step build
          process for the components of the flashlight. Having to split the model into three separate pieces due to the thickness
          of the foam provided some challenges, however the main functions of the flashlight (bending and turning) were unaffected.
          With my careful planning and understanding of the material, the end result was very durable and flexible. </p>

          <li>Developed unique systems that would imitate the functions of the flashlight</li>
          <li>Realistic Button, bendable light fixture, and rotating lens</li>

        <h3>Final Presentation</h3>
        <p>The last part was a written reflection on the design process and a thorough examination about the constraints of the product.
           This included the styles of interaction the user would employ that best suits them and the materials that would be suit a need
           for a rugged and durable environment. It was essential for us to understand these constraints in order to portray a product that
           would make sense in the real world. The final oral presentation was about conveying these aspects of the project to the class
           and professor similar to a product pitch.  </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This project help grow and exhibit my understanding of space and dimensions by converting 2D concepts into 3D forms to create a
          functional prototype. When working on this project I was able to use this ability to the utmost, not only reflecting in the design
          and creation of the prototype but also in how I presented it to the professor and class. This demonstrated my ability to take complex
          ideas and deconstruct them into clear and digestible concepts.</p>
          <br>
        <p><b>Improvements:</b> If I had more time for the project, then I would have spent more time creating more designs I could draw upon when
          deciding on a final concept. That way I would not have to be contained by the restriction of choice I put on myself and really explore
          more ways of conveying the design principles for the flashlight.  on of choice I put on myself and really explore more ways of conveying
          the design principles for the flashlight.
