        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>A group project from the Materials in Design course to design and create a prototype virtual reality headset using specified materials
          for a particular persona. Each group in the class was given two materials to use when fabricating their product. My role in the project
          was being the manager of planning, for a streamlined production timeline, and the primary fabricator, designing and building most of the parts
          and mechanisms. Using fabrication techniques learned in the course, my team and I built a product we were extremely proud of and achieved an A g
          rade for the project.

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>The ideation process was devoted to determining what systems would be used for the interaction styles of the headset, whether it should open
          like a slide or a hatch or if it should have a fabric cap to hold up the headset. Initially I centered my efforts on the headset’s mechanism
          to the exclusion of aesthetics, but after discussing how we wanted the headset to look, I decided to blend pieces from each team member’s designs
          and styles. As they had done more iterations focused on stylized prototypes which fit our selected persona - a kinesiologist - it made sense to
          blend the designs together into what would be the prototype we built. The reflection of the persona on the headset’s design was more for aesthetics over functionality.</p>

        <h3>Prototype: Mock-Up</h3>
        <p>In order to make the process of building the final product a success, I made a scale model out of matte board to get an idea of what it will
          look like when fully built and used it as a reference when building the full prototype. This stage was the point where I explored what mechanisms
          would be used for the functionality of the headset, how it opens and closes, how it holds the phone in, and how it will be attached to the head.
          The mock-up was crucial for understanding the dimensions of the headset together, the build process, and the priority for part creation. </p>

        <h3>Prototype: Final Model</h3>
        <p>Producing the version with the specified materials implemented was the last step in the model making process. Working with metal and plastic
          was a fun challenge as we did not have that much material to work with, due to the budget, so precision was key. The main techniques used in creating
          the parts of the headset were; laser cutting the flat pieces and vacuum forming the outer curved portion where the phone would rest, out of plastic.
           The clips and hinges used metal and fabric for the head strap. The biggest challenge was building the clips for the phone and installing the lenses
           so the headset would work as intended, as it had to be placed precisely to focus on the screen properly.  </p>

        <h3>Final Presentation</h3>
        <p>The final phase of the project was bringing everything that we had learned during the process together and demonstrating the final product.
          My role was copywriting for the poster describing the fabrication process, what materials we selected, and the role of the persona in our design
          consideration. My team and I gave a presentation to the professor about the merits of our design and demonstrated it with an app that examines
          different muscle groups, in alignment with our kinesiologist persona.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>This project allowed me to demonstrate my skills, both technical and interpersonal, to its utmost. I created a quality product with tools I
          had only recently been taught how to use, to the commendation by my professor for my proficiency. I was able to bring the best out of myself
          and my teammates by directing the team’s efforts, working flexibly with their schedules and their skills for an amazing outcome. I’m quite proud of it!</p>
          <br>
        <p><b>Improvements:</b> While the design was functional, comfort (like padding for the nose) was not taken into as much of account as it should have been.
          With more development and testing time, we would have been able to spot the problem. Material restriction was another factor I had to contend with as we
          had to purchase materials ourselves. Fortunately we were able to avoid any major setbacks but there a few scares of running out of material.
