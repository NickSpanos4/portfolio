        <h4>Biography</h4>
        <p>I am currently a third year student at Simon Fraser Universityâ€™s Interactive Arts and Technology
          program focusing on design. I am a driven worker who puts everything into my projects to create the
          best work possible, both written and design. I love working with my hands as I have a great visual
          sense when bringing prototypes from ideation to physical products.

          Outside of school I am a hockey player and boxer, with multiple years experience in both sports.
          I have a passion for reading and writing, particularly sci-fi and fantasy, and like to work on
          different manuscripts for my own novel.</p>

        <!-- +++++++++++++++ GYRE+++++++++++++++++ -->
        <h2 id="gyre">GYRE</h2>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>Group project from Materials in Design course to design and build a flashlight prototype for a specific persona,
          i.e. an electrician or teacher. For this team project, each member came up with their own design concepts for their
          personas and the best would be chosen: mine was chosen. Through the development period, I managed the time and assignment
          of roles to be as efficient as possible, which resulted in an A grade.  The project strengthened my abilities in; ideation
          processes, prototyping skills (modelling), and research (for the persona).
          <b>3 Week Production</b></p>

          </figure>
          <br>
          <h3>Sketching & Dimensioning</h3>
          <p>After I had chosen to design the flashlight for an electrician, I took care to keep the prototype within a specific
            range of percentile measurements, in order to fit the largest margin of people. Taking this into account, I centered the
            design of the flashlight on principles which would best assist an electrician to do their job. These principles included:
            hands free use, focused light projection, and different ways to hold. As I had a limited time for ideation, I settled on
            my initial sketch to move forward with when creating a physical prototype. </p>
          <br>

          </figure>
          <br>
          <h3>Prototype</h3>
          <p>The next step was to transfer the idea from paper to a physical, foam version with help from the detailed sketch.
            Following those measurements and taking into account the characteristics of the material, I took a step-by-step build
            process for the components of the flashlight. Having to split the model into three separate pieces due to the thickness
            of the foam provided some challenges, however the main functions of the flashlight (bending and turning) were unaffected.
            With my careful planning and understanding of the material, the end result was very durable and flexible. </p>

          </figure>
          <br>
          <h3>Final Presentation</h3>
          <p>The last part was a written reflection on the design process and a thorough examination about the constraints of the product.
             This included the styles of interaction the user would employ that best suits them and the materials that would be suit a need
             for a rugged and durable environment. It was essential for us to understand these constraints in order to portray a product that
             would make sense in the real world. The final oral presentation was about conveying these aspects of the project to the class
             and professor similar to a product pitch.  </p>

          <br>
          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>This project help grow and exhibit my understanding of space and dimensions by converting 2D concepts into 3D forms to create a
            functional prototype. When working on this project I was able to use this ability to the utmost, not only reflecting in the design
            and creation of the prototype but also in how I presented it to the professor and class. This demonstrated my ability to take complex
            ideas and deconstruct them into clear and digestible concepts.</p>
            <br>
          <p><b>Improvements:</b> If I had more time for the project, then I would have spent more time creating more designs I could draw upon when
            deciding on a final concept. That way I would not have to be contained by the restriction of choice I put on myself and really explore
            more ways of conveying the design principles for the flashlight.  on of choice I put on myself and really explore more ways of conveying
            the design principles for the flashlight.

          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>A group project from the Materials in Design course to design and create a prototype virtual reality headset using specified materials
            for a particular persona. Each group in the class was given two materials to use when fabricating their product. My role in the project
            was being the manager of planning, for a streamlined production timeline, and the primary fabricator, designing and building most of the parts
            and mechanisms. Using fabrication techniques learned in the course, my team and I built a product we were extremely proud of and achieved an A g
            rade for the project.<b>Month Long Production</b></p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <p>The ideation process was devoted to determining what systems would be used for the interaction styles of the headset, whether it should open
              like a slide or a hatch or if it should have a fabric cap to hold up the headset. Initially I centered my efforts on the headsetâ€™s mechanism
              to the exclusion of aesthetics, but after discussing how we wanted the headset to look, I decided to blend pieces from each team memberâ€™s designs
              and styles. As they had done more iterations focused on stylized prototypes which fit our selected persona - a kinesiologist - it made sense to
              blend the designs together into what would be the prototype we built. The reflection of the persona on the headsetâ€™s design was more for aesthetics over functionality. </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Prototype: Mock-Up</h3>
            <p>In order to make the process of building the final product a success, I made a scale model out of matte board to get an idea of what it will
              look like when fully built and used it as a reference when building the full prototype. This stage was the point where I explored what mechanisms
              would be used for the functionality of the headset, how it opens and closes, how it holds the phone in, and how it will be attached to the head.
              The mock-up was crucial for understanding the dimensions of the headset together, the build process, and the priority for part creation.   </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Prototype: Final Model</h3>
            <p>Producing the version with the specified materials implemented was the last step in the model making process. Working with metal and plastic
              was a fun challenge as we did not have that much material to work with, due to the budget, so precision was key. The main techniques used in creating
              the parts of the headset were; laser cutting the flat pieces and vacuum forming the outer curved portion where the phone would rest, out of plastic.
               The clips and hinges used metal and fabric for the head strap. The biggest challenge was building the clips for the phone and installing the lenses
               so the headset would work as intended, as it had to be placed precisely to focus on the screen properly.  </p>

            <br>
            <h3>Final Presentation</h3>
            <p>The final phase of the project was bringing everything that we had learned during the process together and demonstrating the final product.
              My role was copywriting for the poster describing the fabrication process, what materials we selected, and the role of the persona in our design
              consideration. My team and I gave a presentation to the professor about the merits of our design and demonstrated it with an app that examines
              different muscle groups, in alignment with our kinesiologist persona.</p>
              <br>

              <br>
              <h3>Reflection</h3>
              <p>This project allowed me to demonstrate my skills, both technical and interpersonal, to its utmost. I created a quality product with tools I
                had only recently been taught how to use, to the commendation by my professor for my proficiency. I was able to bring the best out of myself
                and my teammates by directing the teamâ€™s efforts, working flexibly with their schedules and their skills for an amazing outcome. Iâ€™m quite proud of it!</p>
                <br>
              <p><b>Improvements:</b> While the design was functional, comfort (like padding for the nose) was not taken into as much of account as it should have been.
                With more development and testing time, we would have been able to spot the problem. Material restriction was another factor I had to contend with as we
                had to purchase materials ourselves. Fortunately we were able to avoid any major setbacks but there a few scares of running out of material.
